In 2021, HBI was one of two apparel manufacturers named one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere and garnered a spot on Barron’s 100 Most Sustainable Companies for the third consecutive year. This follows the December 2020 announcement that HBI earned “A List” recognition for leadership in corporate sustainability in the CDP 2020 Climate Change Report.

We are committed to making the world a more comfortable, livable and inclusive place. We have established new, wide-ranging 2030 global sustainability goals and launched a new sustainability website, www.HBISustains.com, designed to increase our transparency on key metrics.

Living in Seattle, she fell in love with Pike Place Market with its inspiring blend of products, artisans, and farmers.

When Shirley opened her first store in Pike Place Market, she was determined to assemble the best selection of cookware, gadgets, linens and books—even importing exclusive specialty items from France,  her favorite culinary destination. Using the market as her inspiration, she thoughtfully filled her store with cooking tools that would bring people together in the kitchen and around the table. This sense of connection and love of French cuisine inspired the name Sur La Table, which simply means “on the table.”

Since then we’ve grown to 56 stores across America, with the largest avocational cooking program in the U.S. But some things haven’t changed: We’re still the place for an unsurpassed selection of exclusive and premium-quality goods for the kitchen and table.

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), located in northern Chile, is a joint international partnership between North America, Europe, East Asia, and the Republic of Chile.  Composed of 66 high-precision antennas on a 5000-meter elevation site in the Atacama Desert of Chile, it is the largest ground based global astronomy endeavor in history.  The ALMA Science Center is located at the NRAO headquarters in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The Jansky Very Large Array is located in central New Mexico and is composed of 25 radio telescopes.  The site sits at a 2124-meter elevation and routinely delivers dramatic science results from the Solar System to the most distant galaxies.  The Pete V. Domenici Science Operations Center is located in Socorro, New Mexico.

The technology research and development behind the NRAO telescopes is housed at the NRAO Central Development Laboratory in Charlottesville, Virginia, where they embrace a science-driven research and development program that supports the astronomy community’s highest priority science goals.

New store openings and acquisitions continue to guide Sally’s expansion. In 1987, Sally became an international company with the acquisition of an affiliate in the United Kingdom.  Today, Sally and its affiliates operate over 4500 stores throughout the United States and the world. Our international operations now extend to the United Kingdom, continental Europe, Puerto Rico, Canada, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Mexico.

Expertise in professional product merchandising, distribution and education provides the basis for a commanding presence in the global market.

Our Mission
Creating relationships by delivering amazing experiences.

History
Stivers is a pioneer in staffing with roots dating back to 1945 in the heart of Chicago. In the beginning, founder Clifford Stivers set his recruiting firm apart by devising his own system of testing skills, hiring a statistician to validate test scores, and instituting the concept of quality control, revolutionary practices for the industry at the time. As the company grew, he expanded into Chicago’s suburbs in the early 50s, established branch offices on both coasts in the 60s, then gradually added offices in major cities across the country. Stivers soon became a full-service recruiting firm with a national reach, providing jobs to thousands of people from coast to coast.

Years later, Stivers remains on the leading edge of recruiting, harnessing best practices and advanced technology to give clients and job candidates experiences that transform into long-lasting relationships. While the nature of work has changed through the years, we have always shown a proven ability to find the right talent in an ever-changing job market. Now part of the TalentLaunch Network, our teams have access to better talent and innovative technologies that give us an edge over your typical recruiting company.

48171,Alnylam Pharmaceuticals,"To those who say “impossible, impractical, unrealistic,” we say: “CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.”

Alnylam is the world's leading RNAi therapeutics company and the first and only company to bring RNAi-based medicines to market.

We are developing RNAi (RNA interference) as an innovative, entirely new class of medicines to treat rare genetic, cardio metabolic, acute hepatic infectious and central nervous system (CNS) and ocular diseases.  

Alnylam was founded in 2002 based on a Nobel Prize-winning breakthrough in biology – the discovery of RNAi, and a bold vision that this discovery could be used to silence disease-causing genes upstream of today’s medicines. We are relentless in our pursuit of new treatments because we believe that RNAi therapeutics can be used to treat many diseases for which treatment options do not exist or are inadequate.

Alnylam is turning scientific possibility into reality - in 2018, the FDA and EMA approved of our first product, ONPATTRO (patisiran) which is also the first-ever approved RNAi therapeutic. We now have four additional medicines on the market. Our robust pipeline of investigational medicines includes multiple programs in late-stage and early-stage clinical development.

We are a global and diverse company of 2,000+ people. We pride ourselves on fostering a fun, inclusive and dynamic work environment where employees can recognize their fullest potential. That's why we've been named a Science Magazine Top Employer 5 years in a row ('19-'23), a Boston Globe Top Place to Work 9x in a row ('15-'23) and Fast Company's #1 Best Workplace for Innovators ('22).

76139,"Messerli Kramer, P.A.","WHO WE ARE

At Messerli Kramer, we’ve spent 60 years building a reputation as a firm of “attorneys and advisors” – or, as we like to say, a place where the law isn’t always the best answer. Our attorneys come from an array of backgrounds, and in everything we do, we put people first – not just with our clients, but also with our employees. That means making the right decision at every turn, even if it doesn’t always benefit our bottom line. That’s what makes a healthy work culture. That’s what makes us Messerli Kramer. 

WHAT WE DO
 
Since 1965 we’ve fostered a collaborative environment, one in which the breadth and depth of services available to our clients isn’t limited by ability. That’s why we maintain three offices, each of which focuses on a different aspect of corporate and individual needs – from consumer collections and creditor remedies in Plymouth, to full-service corporate and litigation needs in Minneapolis, to high-powered governmental lobbying in St. Paul. We believe that encouragement, support and respect for one another is what fosters an enviable environment, and that all starts with investing in the right people – with investing in attorneys and advisors.

WHY WE’RE DIFFERENT
 
Our focus of providing sound advice for all clients, regardless of the impact on our bottom line, comes from our ability to operate as boldly independent. With Minnesota-based ownership and a diversified practice distribution designed to withstand economic swings, we are able to nimbly navigate client needs and provide top-notch service at every stage of an interaction.

Founded in 1946 as Chicago Dial, Tru Vue began as a manufacturer of glass for radio dials and later TV screens. One of the company’s first innovations was a process that etched the glass on TV screens, creating a non-glare surface that refracted light and allowed for a much clearer picture. This etched glass product is what brought Tru Vue into the picture framing market in 1970. Discovering that etched-glass technology eliminated the mirror-like reflections associated with framed art, Tru Vue again brought about industry-changing innovation with the introduction of double-sided, etched non-glare picture framing glass.

Today, Tru Vue sets the standard in glazing that enhances, protects, and beautifies.  From custom framing to conservation and preservation in museums and galleries across the globe, to digital displays in automobiles, medical devices and kiosks, Tru Vue is known as a leader and innovator in the protection and conservation of all things framed and displayed.

Serving some of the leading public companies, closely-held organizations, and private equity firms, our experience spans a variety of industries, including those with multi-state and global operations.

Our Brand
Accounting has been called the language of business. It is the way businesses talk about how they are doing with their investors, creditors, and those interested in the company. It is the job of the accounting firm to understand and frame what the numbers represent. That’s what most accounting firms do.

At BMF, we don’t represent numbers. We represent people. We represent the people behind the numbers – the owners and employees who work tirelessly for the success of their company.

Over our 60 years in business, we have come to know that it’s the people who make companies grow and excel. Yes, businesses need knowledge, expertise, and sometimes counsel. Most of all, business people need business partners who are all-in, no matter what.

And that’s why we relentlessly focus on our clients and the relationships we have created over the years. It’s probably why so many blue-chip companies entrust us with their most complex business challenges. Because the only thing that exceeds our expertise is our genuine care for the success and future of our clients. And that’s a language we all understand.

The FNIH helps to underwrite biomedical initiatives that might not be attractive for private funding alone, or for one reason or another are not appropriate for wholly public funding. The FNIH may take on projects that are particularly risky in terms of the likelihood of success or where companies may be willing to forgo profits because of early stage nature of the program or in the case of some global health initiatives due to the charitable nature of the project. 

The FNIH's projects tend to be longer-term, operating on a time scale that can be unattractive for private investors. At the same time the foundation is capable of responding quickly and nimbly to funding needs that are immediate and pressing.

The Fords were cultural, social and economic leaders in an era of great optimism, as well as a turbulent time  of economic depression and world war.  They were nationally prominent and they owned more than one house, but Southeast Michigan was their home.  Here they built their final residence along the shores of Lake St. Clair, at a place known locally as Gaukler Pointe.  Their impressive yet unpretentious home is where they raised and nurtured their four children - Henry II, Benson, Josephine and William - in a safe and loving environment. It reflects their love of family as well as their mutual passion for art and quality design.

The house was designed by Albert Kahn to resemble a cluster of Cotswold village cottages, complete with stone roofs, vine-covered walls and lead-paned windows.  Strolling through the thoughtfully decorated halls, visitors come face-to-face with a stunningly diverse collection of art, antiques and furniture that reveal the Fords' progressive and educated tastes in art and design.

The Ford House grounds are a work of art in their own right.  Designed by famed landscape architect Jens Jensen, the meadow, rockwork and water components appear to be almost completely natural but were meticulously planned.

The estate provided a place for the Fords to relax, raise children and pursue personal interests, shielded from the demands of their public lives.  As steadfast supporters of the community, arts and other philanthropic endeavors, the Fords generously donated to education and medical research while contributing immeasurably to the growth of Detroit's cultural resources.",2,MI,US,Grosse Pointe Shores,48236,1100 Lakeshore Road,https://www.linkedin.com/company/edsel-&-eleanor-ford-house

1330295,Nord-Lock Group,"Nord-Lock Group is a global leader in bolted solutions. 
In 1982, the original Nord-Lock® wedge-locking technology that safely secures bolted joints was developed. Since then, our range of innovative bolting technologies and expertise has grown to be the most comprehensive on the market, incorporating Superbolt™ mechanical tensioners, Boltight™ hydraulic tensioners and Expander® System pivot pins. 
 
Nord-Lock 
Nord-Lock created the original wedge-locking technology that secures bolted joints, even when exposed to severe vibration and dynamic loads. It is impossible for our washer products to loosen unintentionally due to the wedge created underneath the bolt head and nut. 

Superbolt 
Superbolt was the world’s first to revolutionize nuts and bolts with multi-jackbolt tensioning (MJT). Superbolt MJTs take high preload requirements and break them down into manageable torques, using the jackbolts threaded through the nut body. 

Boltight 
Boltight has been at the forefront of hydraulic bolt tensioning for over a decade. Our tensioning tools provide fast, accurate and safe solutions to tighten and loosen multiple bolts simultaneously. 

Expander System 
Expander System is a permanent solution to lug wear, replacing traditional axle pins. It works for first-fit installations, preventing the formation of lug wear, or for aftermarket repairs without the need for welding and line boring - for any machine, make or model. 
 
The Nord-Lock Group believes that no one should have to question the integrity of the mechanical systems that play such a critical role in our way of life. All solutions are developed and manufactured in-house, ensuring they meet the highest standards in the industry. Our team of dedicated experts work closely with customers all over the world.

The original invention on which Cyclonaire was founded was developed and patented in the early 1960's by Roe Black of Aurora, Nebraska. Black's invention relied on a single 15 PSI blower combined with a Venturi to vacuum load and discharge a five cubic foot pressure tank into a convey line.

In 1966, the manufacturing rights were sold to York Manufacturing Company. At that time, the “pneumatic transporter” was best known for the role it played in the construction of Interstate 80 through Central Nebraska. Much of the cement used in the construction was unloaded from railcars by Cyclonaire equipment.

In 1973, Cyclonaire Corporation was founded, and the marketing and manufacturing rights for Cyclonaire were purchased. Since then, Cyclonaire has experienced steady growth.

3542368,Rohan Woods School,"Discover a the Project Approach to elementary Education

Rohan Woods School prepares every child for success by providing a challenging and engaging Project Approach and academic program that encompasses respect, responsibility and leadership.

Before incorporating the Project Approach into our curriculum, Rohan Woods faculty and staff visited and studied at Duke School in Durham, North Carolina – a leader in Project Learning.  As the project approach evolved, students built on their unique interests and talents and became experts in a particular area of the project topic. Through project work students not only learn new concepts and content, they develop the competencies essential for future learning: the ability to formulate essential questions, conduct research both independently and collaboratively, evaluate and synthesize results, present those results to others, and reflect on the strengths of their work and the ways they can improve.  Project provides a platform for engaging students with challenging academics that put the emphasis on student involvement.  This approach also encourages leadership skill development in teamwork, planning and presentation. 

Project Approach Model

Rohan Woods School bases its project work on the Project Approach model developed by Lilian Katz and Sylvia Chard. Katz and Chard define a project as an in-depth investigation of a real-world topic worthy of the children’s attention and effort (Chard, 1998). The Project Approach projects follow four distinct stages:

PROJECT APPROACH
STAGE 1:  PRELIMINARY PLANNING
STAGE 2: BEGINNING A PROJECT
STAGE 3: DEVELOPING A PROJECT
STAGE 4: CONCLUDING A PROJECT",1,MO,US,Saint Louis,63122,1515 Bennett Avenue,https://www.linkedin.com/company/rohan-woods-school

5025162,Tech-Nique Partners,"The technical recruiting industry has changed rapidly over the past decade. What was once a “people” business, driven more by relationships than spreadsheets, has become transactional and volume based. Candidates are often now reduced to names in databases; their personalities are ignored, written off as irrelevant in the face of ever more complicated KPIs. Generic job descriptions are the norm. Meetings have been replaced with emails and resumes are doctored up to better match job descriptions. Is it any wonder that retention has become such a challenge?

Instead of furthering this problem, we chose to break away from the herd. Recruiting isn’t arithmetic. It’s an art and a science: equal parts creative problem solving and critical examination. Tech-Nique Partners focuses on our clients’ organizational culture, the current technical environment, and the psychology and desires of candidates. Our sincere belief is that these three things matter much more than any arbitrary metric, and our clients tend to agree.

The recipe for economic success does not lie solely in a company’s size or tools. The past decade has taught global businesses as much. Rather, the overlooked but critical third element is the people organizations employ. And yet, counterintuitively, the arts of human capital management and true client services are diminishing. We mean to serve and a bulwark against that.

Our philosophy,  the path to success is a very simple recipe for Julien and Fabian: high quality products made with Love, + amazing collaborative team = successful company. It’s as simple as that!
So simple in fact that you see and feel it the very moment you step into bakerly’s Miami office. Our happy, calm, people-centered atmosphere inspires everything we create. You can feel it as well when you visit our brand new, state-of-the-art factory (which we affectionately call “The Barn”) in Easton, PA. 
And it looks like our efforts are paying off…we have been growing double or even triple digit for the past 3 years! 

A few more things to love about our incredible team atmosphere:
-	Enjoy Fabian’s occasional crepe cook-off, and taste what made his French restaurants so successful!
-	Become a NBA player at the neighborhood playground!
-	Learn to love the unique jokes of Charles, our Supply Chain manager!
-	Very Secrete spots of Kitesurfing from Julien! But Shut...don’t tell to anybody else!
-	Participate in our Halloween costume competitions (our crazy Senior Graphic Designer Mauricio won again this year!). 
Our ideal candidate is someone who: 
-	Loves to cook and loves food 
-	Possesses a can-do attitude 
-	Isn’t just looking for a job, but a career with coworkers they’d soon consider family
-	Has goals to surpass expectations, not just meet the minimum requirements

Our core promise is to be the best-prepared contractor for this kind of work. How we keep this promise comes down to three things:

The way we screen, train and retain top professionals. Because we hire for longevity, we take great care in assessing prospective employees and trying them out. Our culture and highly competitive pay and benefits keeps them here.

How we plan for, and adapt to, our project work. From initial estimating to building turnover, B&K uses advanced technology to integrate data into all steps and facets of a project to assure pricing, protect scheduling and promote accountability. We perform prefabrication work in a 90,000 square-foot, state-of-the-art facility. And to provide consistent quality, we work only with a select group of experienced subcontractors, whom we’ve partnered with for decades. 

How we view our craft and ourselves. We demand high performance from our people, and we provide them with unbending support in their jobs. As a rule, we think about others first, envisioning what our HVAC and plumbing work will be like for those who build, use and maintain the facilities we support. And because we see ourselves as problem solvers, we actively put lessons from projects back into our practice.

After construction, B&K’s factory-trained technicians can maintain facility operations, from preventive contracts to emergency service to 24/7/365 on-site monitoring.

WHY IT WORKS: From experience, we designed TrustMAPP to be a better way to assess cybersecurity performance and maturity. It offers a standardized methodology, customizable assessments, and exceptional visibility into completion status.

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT: TrustMAPP gives CISOs a real-time view of their cybersecurity performance. TrustMAPP tells you where you are, where you’re going, and what it will take to get there. From a single source of data, an organization’s security posture is visible based on stakeholder perspectives: CISO, C-Suite, and Board. In addition, TrustMAPP gives organizations the ability to manage security as a business, quantifying and prioritizing remediation actions and costs. 

HOW IT WORKS:

- Brief vetting for good fit
- Perform a Demo
- Onboarding

WHAT OTHERS SAY: We pioneered Cyber Security Performance Management and in July 2021 Gartner recognized this as a market category on their Hype Cycle.

MasterMind is built for size, stability, speed, efficiency, and automation within and across functional areas. Built by logistics experts, MasterMind provides unprecedented visibility and control by embracing the complexity that is the reality of the supply chain world.

For more than 40 years, the industry has grown with patchwork tools built for specific jobs. And complexity continues to soar.

Supply Chains have generally been disconnected, and disconnected systems force manual intervention to deliver desired results. With multiple tools and multiple work streams, labor and IT costs compound with no guarantee of a single view into a given Supply Chain. Waste and inefficiency abound. When multiple systems are used to manage operational activity across business units, workstreams and networks, it creates complexities that can be challenging to manage and costly to manage.

Companies often sub-optimize one or more of those functions by attempting to fit it into a transportation management system that is adequate at another function, creating friction between systems or added work. Mastery solves this problem by bringing all operating functions into a single cloud-based TMS, providing flexibility, visibility, control, and efficiency.

Realizing sawdust’s green potential
We’re a family of brands dedicated to producing high quality, 100% natural products that turn wood waste into a range of premium eco-friendly products. 

Our commitment to creating premium-grade wood products is central to everything we do.  As a family of brands we own and manage 13 mills across the country that turn wood waste into clean, green products.  Our eco-friendly offering includes premium wood pellets, logs and fire starters for super-efficient heating, seasoned BBQ pellets that naturally seals in food flavor, and highly-absorbent animal bedding that ensures warmth and comfort.  We’re dedicated to making the best performing and most trusted natural wood products in America, and welcome you to experience the Lignetics Brands difference.

Lignetics is the largest residential wood pellet manufacturing company in the U.S. which now has a production capacity of over 1,000,000 tons of wood pellets per year.  We are the only pellet manufacturing company that has wood pellet manufacturing plants on both the East Coast and the West Coast as well as the Mid-West with locations in the New Hampshire, New York, Maine,  West Virginia, Virginia, Wisconsin, Oregon and Idaho.

Our Mission
Inspire warm, clean, flavorful living by turning wood waste into premium quality, environmentally friendly products.

Our Products
Recycling the Earth’s wood

As industry pioneers for over 30 years, we’ve always been driven to put the environment first. Our 100% sustainable wood products are made from pressed sawdust sourced from mills across the United States.  We hand select the best, most efficient hard and softwoods to naturally produce a range of heating, cooking and bedding products that are manufactured to exceed industry standards.  From higher heat ratings to longer lasting burns, our commitment to quality is paramount. 

Our Commitment to Sustainability
Respecting process and people

We don’t believe in taking shortcuts.  From our products to the way we manufacture to where we work, every aspect of our process is thoughtfully approached with sustainability in mind.  You’ll only find 100% natural wood shavings and sawdust with no fillers in everything we make.  And we have 13 mills across the country in order to reduce the impact of transporting goods — and just as importantly create jobs for local economies.

To learn more about our sustainable pellets click here.

Our Roots
Rethinking heat as we know it

Over thirty years ago, pellet stoves were developed as an eco-friendly, cost-efficient alternative to traditional heating sources. Good thing for us.  That’s where the inspiration to create sustainable products began.  And it’s ignited our passion ever since.

While sawmills that primed lumber saw useless mounds of wood shavings and waste, we envisioned a whole new way to heat homes across America.  That’s why we began creating high-quality wood pellets that burn hot and clean.  Thankfully, the idea caught on with customers too.  Now that our family of brands has expanded, we employ over 350 people in 13 different mills and our products are sold at over 3,000 retailers across the U.S.  While we may be bigger, we still remain focused on doing better for the earth. 

Next time you’re enjoying a cozy night beside the crackling fire, a delicious meal or watching one of your animals rest comfortable, thing about all the good you’re doing.

We find the Accountancy and Finance professionals who enable your organisation to be brilliant.

WHY 

Our founder’s direct experience of supporting a Finance team in-sourcing led him to a realisation: these people were the real heroes. Sure, driving sales was critical, but it became clear that the success of any organisation depended upon the quality of their Accounting and Finance professionals. 

Contacting recruitment firms in the market to help, he found the services unresponsive: poor candidate care and low quality networks seemed to be the norm. While their communications and offering treated all Accountants as dull number-crunching automatons.

Harmonic was born as a response to this. We have the hands-on experience of leading Finance teams which enables us to offer a superior service:brief us on systems implementations and we've shared the sleepless nights.Ditto when you're going through end of year reporting.


HOW

Candidate care is king. And funnily enough, that translates into fantastic client service. Every Harmonic candidate is treated to the same rock-star standard, whatever their seniority. Interactions with us are fun, fast and- above all- honest. And we build long-term relationships over lunch, not just via email. The result?
